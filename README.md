# 🧪 Homebrew Tap: `chat`

This repo is the **Homebrew formula** for installing [CLI-Chat 🦉](https://github.com/Onaga08/chat-server) — a cross-platform, authenticated, real-time terminal chat client.

> “Why use Slack when you can vibe in the terminal?”

---

## 🍺 Installation

Just tap this repo and install the chat CLI like a wizard:

```bash
brew tap Onaga08/chat
brew install chat
````

Then launch the chat client:

```bash
chat
```

It'll ask you for a nickname and token (because even owls need ID 🪪).

## 🦉 What's Inside

* 🧠 Authenticated WebSocket messaging
* 🎯 Minimalist, zero-bloat terminal UI
* 🔐 Token-based session validation
* 🪟 Windows `.exe` and macOS `brew` support
* 💬 Rich-text commands and feedback

---

## 💡 Notes

* This tap only delivers the macOS version (via `brew`).
* If you're on Windows, grab the `.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/Onaga08/chat-server/releases).
* Linux folks can use `python chat.py` — you're daring, figure it out 😉
